## Taking the Leap: A Decision that Changed My Life

Two years ago, I made a decision that changed my life. I decided to learn to code.

At the time, I was in a completely different industry, feeling unfulfilled and searching for something more. The idea of switching careers and diving into the world of software engineering was both exhilarating and terrifying. But I was ready for the challenge.

## The Struggles and Triumphs of Learning to Code

Learning to code on my own wasn't easy. I spent countless nights and weekends studying, practicing, and sometimes failing. There were moments of doubt and frustration, times when the code just wouldn't work, and I questioned my decision. But I pushed through, driven by a passion to create and a belief that I could build something meaningful.

After months of dedication, I started to see progress. I built my first small projects, each one a stepping stone towards my goal. The satisfaction of solving problems and creating something from nothing was incredible. I knew I had found my calling.

## Launching My Startup: Turning Ideas into Reality

Fast forward to today, I am a software engineer and have just launched my own startup, [Planitly](https://planitly.com/). My journey has been nothing short of amazing. I've had the opportunity to turn ideas into reality, creating an [AI-powered travel planning app](https://planitly.com/) that provides personalized itineraries, recommendations, and more.

## The Power of Coding: Solving Problems and Helping People

The skills I've learned over the past two years have empowered me to identify problems and code solutions. The ability to create software that helps people is a fantastic feeling. It's a testament to the power of coding and the endless possibilities it offers.

## Lessons Learned: Determination, Resilience, and Passion

My journey from a career change to launching my own app has taught me many valuable lessons. I've learned that with determination, resilience, and passion, you can achieve your dreams. The struggles and challenges along the way have only made the successes even sweeter.

## Encouragement for Aspiring Coders

To anyone considering a career change or learning a new skill, I encourage you to take the leap. It won't be easy, but the rewards are worth it. Follow your passion, stay committed, and believe in yourself. You have the power to create something amazing.
