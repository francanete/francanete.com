**Introduction:**
TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that enhances the language with static typing capabilities. By explicitly defining data types, TypeScript enables developers to catch errors early in the development process, leading to more robust and maintainable code. In this article, we will delve into the basic data types provided by TypeScript, along with step-by-step explanations and code examples to illustrate their usage.

1. **Number:**
   The number data type in TypeScript represents both integer and floating-point numbers. To declare a variable with a number type, simply use the `number` keyword.

```typescript
let age: number = 30;
let height: number = 5.9;
```

2. **String:**
   Strings are sequences of characters and are declared using either single or double quotes.

```typescript
let firstName: string = "John";
let lastName: string = "Doe";
```

3. **Boolean:**
   Booleans represent true or false values.

```typescript
let isStudent: boolean = true;
let hasCar: boolean = false;
```

4. **Array:**
   Arrays are collections of elements of the same type. To define an array, use square brackets with the type followed by `[]`.

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let fruits: string[] = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
```

5. **Tuple:**
   Tuples allow you to express an array with a fixed number of elements, each having a specific type. The order of the types in the tuple is significant.

```typescript
let person: [string, number] = ["John", 30];
```

6. **Enum:**
   Enums are a set of named constants, making it easier to work with sets of numeric values.

```typescript
enum Color {
  Red,
  Green,
  Blue,
}

let favoriteColor: Color = Color.Blue;
```

7. **Any:**
   The `any` type allows variables to hold values of any data type. This can be useful when working with dynamic data or during the transition from JavaScript to TypeScript.

```typescript
let dynamicValue: any = 42;
dynamicValue = "hello";
```

8. **Void:**
   The `void` type is used for functions that do not return any value.

```typescript
function logMessage(message: string): void {
  console.log(message);
}
```

9. **Null and Undefined:**
   In TypeScript, `null` and `undefined` are separate types representing the absence of a value. By default, variables are initialized with `undefined`.

```typescript
let notDefined: undefined = undefined;
let mayBeNull: null = null;
```

10. **Union:**
    Union types allow a variable to hold values of multiple types.

```typescript
let nameOrAge: string | number = "John";
nameOrAge = 30;
```

11. **Type Assertion:**
    Type assertion allows developers to explicitly tell the compiler about the type of a variable when the type inference may not be accurate.

```typescript
let someValue: any = "this is a string";
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;
```

**Conclusion:**
Understanding basic data types is a fundamental step in leveraging the full potential of TypeScript. By enforcing strong typing, TypeScript empowers developers to write safer and more efficient code. In this article, we covered the essential data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, tuples, enums, any, void, null, undefined, and union types, as well as type assertions. Armed with this knowledge, you can confidently start building robust TypeScript applications while harnessing the power of static typing.

Remember, TypeScript continues to evolve with each new release, offering even more exciting features to improve your development experience further. Happy coding!
